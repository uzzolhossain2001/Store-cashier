Supermarket Cashier System in C++

Requirements:

My task is to design a cashier system for a supermarket. The price list of products in the store is shown below:
 
Item: Milk	         Barcode:	120001	        Price: 10.50

Item: Bread	         Barcode:	120002	        Price: 5.50

Item: Chocolate	     Barcode:	120003	        Price: 8.00

Item: Towel	         Barcode:	120004	        Price: 12.10

Item: Toothpaste	   Barcode:	120005	        Price: 6.75

Item: Soap	         Barcode:	120006	        Price: 5.20

Item: Pen	           Barcode:	120007	        Price: 2.00

Item: Biscuits	     Barcode:	120008	        Price: 4.45

Item: Lamp	         Barcode:	120009	        Price: 20.50

Item: Battery	       Barcode:	120010	        Price: 10.00

The system should then prompt the user to enter barcodes, in the form of one entry per line. For each barcode entry, the system will search the database and locate the item’s name and price. If no match can be found, the program should display an error message. The barcode entry process should repeat until the user enters ‘F’ to finish, and then the total price should be calculated and displayed. Sample output may be:

The system will then ask for the required payment and calculate any resulting change. If an insufficient amount of payment has been received, the system should prompt for more payment. Sample output:

Upon completion, prompt for the next customer and repeat the same process as above. Sample output:
