Supermarket Cashier System in C++

Requirements:

My task is to design a cashier system for a supermarket. The price list of products in the store is shown below:

Item	         Barcode	     Price
Milk	         120001	       10.50
Bread	         120002	       5.50
Chocolate	     120003	       8.00
Towel	         120004	       12.10
Toothpaste	   120005	       6.75
Soap	         120006	       5.20
Pen	           120007	       2.00
Biscuits	     120008	       4.45
Lamp	         120009	       20.50
Battery	       120010	       10.00

The system should then prompt the user to enter barcodes, in the form of one entry per line. For each barcode entry, the system will search the database and locate the item’s name and price. If no match can be found, the program should display an error message. The barcode entry process should repeat until the user enters ‘F’ to finish, and then the total price should be calculated and displayed. Sample output may be:

The system will then ask for the required payment and calculate any resulting change. If an insufficient amount of payment has been received, the system should prompt for more payment. Sample output:

Upon completion, prompt for the next customer and repeat the same process as above. Sample output:
